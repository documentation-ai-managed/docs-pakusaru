  ```mdx
  ## Welcome

  Use <Callout kind="info">components</Callout> for rich content.

  ```javascript
  console.log('Pakusaru docs');
  ```
  ```
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ title: 'New Doc', content: '# Hello' })
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Enable auto-save to prevent data loss during long editing sessions.

## Folder and Page Organization

Organize large documentation sets with nested folders and pages. Drag and drop to reorder, and use slugs for clean URLs.

graph TD
    A[Project Root] --> B[API]
    A --> C[Guides]
    B --> D[Authentication]
    B --> E[Endpoints]
    C --> F[Quickstart]
    C --> G[Troubleshooting]

Customize navigation with frontmatter in your MDX files:
